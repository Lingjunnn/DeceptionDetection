## About
A story deception detection project using machine learning for CBU5201.   
Using random forest to select the most significant features, SVM was applied as a classifier. Achieved 0.67 training accuracy and 0.7 test accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset is from [this repository](https://github.com/CBU5201Datasets/Deception). You can download the `.wav` and attribute files here.

## Jupyter notebooks
Have both Chinese and English versions.

## What else
- Include some classifiers I've tried. Due to the small amount of audio, it's extremely easy to get overfitting.  
- The requirement has been uploaded.  
- Also add the extracted features. You can use it directly since feature extraction is time-consuming.
